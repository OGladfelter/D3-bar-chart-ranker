# D3 Bar Chart Ranker for Data Visualization Society Mentees

Example code for a D3 bar chart ranker.

### Simple Bar Chart Ranker

Generated by code in `simplerScript.js`

### Advanced Bar Chart Ranker

Generated by code in `script.js`. Nothing too fancy, but does add on transition/animation effects and a tooltip. 

#### Challenge

In a separate branch, attempt to:

- Change the colors of the bars and make the low-ranking states to appear more faint? 
  - Hint: you can place values such as `rgba(20, 100, 20, 0.2)` in `.range(['blue', 'red'])` instead of a color name or hex
- Change the transition speed for the animation effect that occurs when a user selects a different happiness metric.
  - Hint: look for `.transition().duration(1500)`
- The chart is too tall (1.5x screen height) for mobile users. Can you fix that?
- The y-axis only labels every 5 ticks and pulls data from the `lifeSatRank` column in `stateData.csv`. 
  - Try to label every single tick, or only every 10 ticks, etc.
  - Programmatically compute the rank values, such that the `lifeSatRank` column can be deleted
- Anything else that you think would be fun a good idea, fun, or doable! 
- Remember to push all your changes to Github in a separate branch (in terminal, start with `git checkout -b your-custom-branch-name` before making any changes).
